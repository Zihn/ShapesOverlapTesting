# ShapesOverlapTesting
Testing some overlap techniques and other stuff.. Most of this is used in the Shapes project.

Please be prepared of crappy code and some messy stuff..

To see the overlap working:
--------------------------

When loaded in Unity load scene <b>v0.5 Get Shape Intersections</b>
Start game
Click <b>Magic</b> Object.. 
Then select spawn objects

Please make sure that the following bools are turned off!
- <i>Random scale</i>
- <i>Linear Scale</i>
in Colorize Objects script -> <i>Allow no fill</i>

This is not implemented yet so overlapping calculations will not work properly when these are turned on.
